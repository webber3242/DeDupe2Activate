üöÄ Features
Intelligent Duplicate Detection

Advanced URL Pattern Matching: Uses modern URLPattern API with fallback support for comprehensive duplicate detection
Subdomain Awareness: Treats www.example.com and example.com as duplicates
Path Normalization: Handles trailing slashes and path variations intelligently
Sequential Pattern Checking: Optimized algorithm with early exit when duplicates are found
Cached Pattern Storage: Efficient LRU cache system with automatic memory management

Smart Tab Selection Algorithm
The extension uses a sophisticated priority system to determine which tab to keep:

üéØ Active Tab Priority: Currently active tabs are preferred
üîä Audio Playback: Tabs playing audio are prioritized
üìå Pinned Status: Pinned tabs take precedence
‚è∞ Load Completion: More recently completed/created tabs are favored
üî¢ Tab Age: Older tabs (lower tab ID) win final ties

Performance Optimized Architecture

Debounced Processing: Prevents excessive duplicate checks during rapid navigation (300ms default)
Two-Tier Operation: Optimized single-tab detection for real-time events + bulk operations for startup
Memory Management: Automatic cleanup with configurable intervals and cache size limits
Selective Processing: Ignores localhost, internal pages, and browser URLs
Pattern Caching: LRU cache with configurable size limits (1000 patterns max)

Advanced Memory Management

Enhanced Tab Tracker: Tracks processing states, completion times, and creation timestamps
Automatic Cleanup: Removes stale data every 60 seconds
Cache Size Control: Maintains optimal cache size with LRU eviction
Processing State Tracking: Prevents duplicate processing of the same tab

üì¶ Installation
From Chrome Web Store

Visit the Chrome Web Store page (link pending publication)
Click "Add to Chrome"
Confirm installation in the popup dialog

Manual Installation (Developer Mode)

Download or clone this repository:
bashgit clone https://github.com/webber3242/DeDupe2Activate.git

Open Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions/
Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner
Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension folder
The extension will be installed and ready to use

Prerequisites

Google Chrome version 88+ (for Manifest V3 support)
Modern browser with URLPattern API support (recommended, fallback available)

üéØ Usage
Automatic Operation
Once installed, DeDupe2Activate works automatically in the background:

Real-time Detection: Duplicate tabs are closed immediately upon creation or navigation
Early Navigation Interception: Catches duplicates before page load completes
Background Processing: Continuously manages duplicates without user intervention
Startup Cleanup: Automatically runs bulk cleanup 2-3 seconds after browser/extension start

Dual Operation Modes
Real-time Mode (Single Tab Events)

Uses optimized single-tab duplicate detection
Processes tabs.onCreated, webNavigation.onBeforeNavigate, and webNavigation.onCompleted
Sequential pattern matching with early exit for maximum efficiency

Bulk Mode (Manual Cleanup)

Uses parallel processing for all tabs
Groups tabs by normalized URL keys
Triggered on startup and extension installation

What Counts as a Duplicate?
The extension considers URLs duplicates when they have:

Same normalized hostname (with or without www.)
Same normalized path (ignoring trailing slashes)
Protocol-agnostic matching (http/https)

Examples of detected duplicates:

‚úÖ https://example.com/page and https://www.example.com/page/
‚úÖ http://example.com/path and https://example.com/path
‚úÖ https://site.com/ and https://site.com

‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
Customizable Constants
You can modify these values in background.js:
javascriptconst CONFIG = {
    DEBOUNCE_DELAY: 300,              // Milliseconds between duplicate checks
    TAB_REMOVAL_DELAY: 50,            // Delay before activating kept tab
    CLEANUP_INTERVAL: 60000,          // Memory cleanup frequency (1 minute)
    IGNORED_DOMAINS: new Set(['localhost', '127.0.0.1', 'chrome-extension']),
    INCLUDE_QUERY_PARAMS: false,      // Whether to consider query params
    MAX_CACHE_SIZE: 1000,             // Maximum cached URL patterns
    CLEANUP_RETENTION_SIZE: 250,      // Patterns to keep after cleanup
    COMPLETION_TIMEOUT: 300000        // 5 minutes - data retention timeout
};
Domain Filtering
The extension automatically ignores certain domains and can be customized:
javascriptIGNORED_DOMAINS: new Set([
    'localhost', 
    '127.0.0.1', 
    'chrome-extension',
    'your-custom-domain.com'  // Add your domains here
])
üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

Key Functions
Single-Tab Operations

findDuplicatesForSingleTab(): Optimized duplicate detection with pattern caching
_handleSingleTabDuplicates(): Real-time duplicate processing with debouncing

Bulk Operations

findAllDuplicates(): Parallel processing of all tabs with URL grouping
closeAllDuplicates(): Bulk duplicate removal with parallel execution

Selection Algorithm

selectBestTab(): Multi-criteria tab selection with priority system

Opening multiple tabs with the same URL
Navigating existing tabs to duplicate URLs
Testing www vs non-www variations
Checking http vs https protocol handling
Restarting Chrome to test startup cleanup
