Why This Extension?
Ever opened the same webpage in multiple tabs by accident? Or clicked a bookmark only to realize you already had that page open? This extension fixes that annoyance by automatically closing duplicate tabs while being smart about which one to keep.
Features
Smart Duplicate Detection

Recognizes when example.com and www.example.com are the same site
Handles URLs with and without trailing slashes
Works with both HTTP and HTTPS versions of the same page
Ignores localhost and browser internal pages

Intelligent Tab Selection
When duplicates are found, the extension keeps the "best" tab based on:

üéØ Active tab (the one you're currently viewing)
üîä Playing audio (don't close that music!)
üìå Pinned tabs
‚è∞ Most recently loaded
Oldest tab (as a tiebreaker)

Performance Features

Processes duplicates instantly when you open them
Catches duplicates before pages even finish loading
Cleans up existing duplicates when Chrome starts
Uses smart caching to avoid slowing down your browser

üì¶ Installation
From Chrome Web Store:
Coming soon - link will be added once published.
Manual Installation:

Download this repo or clone it: git clone https://github.com/webber3242/DeDupe2Activate.git
Go to chrome://extensions/
Turn on "Developer mode" (top right)
Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension folder

Works with Chrome 88+ (needs Manifest V3 support).
How It Works
Once installed, it just runs in the background. No setup needed.
Real-time duplicate closing:

Open a duplicate tab ‚Üí it closes immediately
Navigate to a duplicate URL ‚Üí closes the duplicate
The extension figures out which tab to keep automatically

Startup cleanup:

When Chrome starts, it scans for any existing duplicates and cleans them up


## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

You can tweak these settings by editing the `CONFIG` object in `background.js`:

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
    DEBOUNCE_DELAY: 300,              // How long to wait between checks (ms)
    TAB_REMOVAL_DELAY: 50,            // Delay before switching to kept tab
    CLEANUP_INTERVAL: 60000,          // Memory cleanup frequency
    MAX_CACHE_SIZE: 1000,             // Max cached URL patterns
    COMPLETION_TIMEOUT: 300000        // 5 minutes - how long to remember tabs
};
```

**Adding domains to ignore:**
```javascript
IGNORED_DOMAINS: new Set([
    'localhost', 
    '127.0.0.1', 
    'chrome-extension',
    'internal-site.company.com'  // Add your own here
])
```

## Technical Stuff

### Architecture
The extension has three main parts:

**URLPatternHandler** - Figures out when URLs are duplicates
- Uses the modern URLPattern API when available
- Falls back to manual parsing for older browsers
- Normalizes URLs for comparison

**EnhancedTabTracker** - Keeps track of what's happening with tabs
- Remembers which tabs are being processed
- Caches URL patterns to speed things up
- Cleans up old data automatically

**DuplicateTabManager** - The main controller
- Handles both real-time and bulk duplicate detection
- Manages all the Chrome extension events
- Decides which tabs to keep or close

### How Duplicate Detection Works

**For single tabs (real-time):**
1. Extension notices a new/changed tab
2. Quickly checks if any existing tabs match
3. Closes duplicates immediately, keeps the best one

**For bulk operations (startup):**
1. Gets all open tabs
2. Groups them by normalized URL
3. In each group, keeps the best tab and closes the rest

### Event Handling
- `tabs.onCreated` - New tab opened
- `webNavigation.onBeforeNavigate` - Tab is about to navigate (catches duplicates early)
- `webNavigation.onCompleted` - Page finished loading
- `runtime.onStartup` - Chrome started, clean up duplicates
- `runtime.onInstalled` - Extension installed/updated

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### File Structure
```
DeDupe2Activate/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manifest.json     # Extension config
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ background.js     # All the logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ images/          # Icons
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md        # This file

### Key Functions
- `findDuplicatesForSingleTab()` - Fast duplicate check for one tab
- `findAllDuplicates()` - Bulk duplicate detection for all tabs
- `selectBestTab()` - Decides which tab to keep
- `closeDuplicate()` - Safely removes a duplicate tab

### Testing
Try these scenarios:
1. Open multiple tabs to the same URL
2. Navigate existing tabs to URLs that are already open
3. Test with www vs non-www versions
4. Try http vs https
5. Test with pinned tabs, active tabs, tabs playing audio
6. Restart Chrome to test startup cleanup
