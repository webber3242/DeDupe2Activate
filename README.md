## Why This Extension?

Ever opened the same webpage in multiple tabs by accident? Or clicked a bookmark only to realize you already had that page open? This extension fixes that annoyance by automatically closing duplicate tabs while being smart about which one to keep.

## Features

### Smart Duplicate Detection
- Recognizes when `example.com` and `www.example.com` are the same site
- Handles URLs with and without trailing slashes
- Works with both HTTP and HTTPS versions of the same page
- Ignores localhost and browser internal pages

### Intelligent Tab Selection
When duplicates are found, the extension keeps the "best" tab based on:
- üéØ Active tab (the one you're currently viewing)
- üîä Playing audio (don't close that music!)
- üìå Pinned tabs
- ‚è∞ Most recently loaded
- Oldest tab (as a tiebreaker)

### Performance Features
- Processes duplicates instantly when you open them
- Catches duplicates before pages even finish loading  
- Cleans up existing duplicates when Chrome starts
- Uses smart caching to avoid slowing down your browser

## üì¶ Installation

**From Chrome Web Store:**
Coming soon - link will be added once published.

**Manual Installation:**
1. Download this repo or clone it: `git clone https://github.com/webber3242/DeDupe2Activate.git`
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Turn on "Developer mode" (top right)
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension folder

Works with Chrome 88+ (needs Manifest V3 support).

## How It Works

Once installed, it just runs in the background. No setup needed.

**Real-time duplicate closing:**
- Open a duplicate tab ‚Üí it closes immediately
- Navigate to a duplicate URL ‚Üí closes the duplicate
- The extension figures out which tab to keep automatically

**Startup cleanup:**
- When Chrome starts, it scans for any existing duplicates and cleans them up

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

You can tweak these settings by editing the `CONFIG` object in `background.js`:

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
    DEBOUNCE_DELAY: 300,              // How long to wait between checks (ms)
    TAB_REMOVAL_DELAY: 50,            // Delay before switching to kept tab
    CLEANUP_INTERVAL: 60000,          // Memory cleanup frequency
    MAX_CACHE_SIZE: 1000,             // Max cached URL patterns
    COMPLETION_TIMEOUT: 300000        // 5 minutes - how long to remember tabs
};
```

**Adding domains to ignore:**
```javascript
IGNORED_DOMAINS: new Set([
    'localhost', 
    '127.0.0.1', 
    'chrome-extension',
    'internal-site.company.com'  // Add your own here
])
```

## Technical Stuff

### Architecture
The extension has three main parts:

**URLPatternHandler** - Figures out when URLs are duplicates
- Uses the modern URLPattern API when available
- Falls back to manual parsing for older browsers
- Normalizes URLs for comparison

**EnhancedTabTracker** - Keeps track of what's happening with tabs
- Remembers which tabs are being processed
- Caches URL patterns to speed things up
- Cleans up old data automatically

**DuplicateTabManager** - The main controller
- Handles both real-time and bulk duplicate detection
- Manages all the Chrome extension events
- Decides which tabs to keep or close

### How Duplicate Detection Works

**For single tabs (real-time):**
1. Extension notices a new/changed tab
2. Quickly checks if any existing tabs match
3. Closes duplicates immediately, keeps the best one

**For bulk operations (startup):**
1. Gets all open tabs
2. Groups them by normalized URL
3. In each group, keeps the best tab and closes the rest

### Event Handling
- `tabs.onCreated` - New tab opened
- `webNavigation.onBeforeNavigate` - Tab is about to navigate (catches duplicates early)
- `webNavigation.onCompleted` - Page finished loading
- `runtime.onStartup` - Chrome started, clean up duplicates
- `runtime.onInstalled` - Extension installed/updated

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### File Structure
```

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manifest.json     # Extension config
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ background.js     # All the logic

### Key Functions
- `findDuplicatesForSingleTab()` - Fast duplicate check for one tab
- `findAllDuplicates()` - Bulk duplicate detection for all tabs
- `selectBestTab()` - Decides which tab to keep
- `closeDuplicate()` - Safely removes a duplicate tab

### Testing
Try these scenarios:
1. Open multiple tabs to the same URL
2. Navigate existing tabs to URLs that are already open
3. Test with www vs non-www versions
4. Try http vs https
5. Test with pinned tabs, active tabs, tabs playing audio
6. Restart Chrome to test startup cleanup
