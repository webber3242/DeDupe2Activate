<h1>Privacy Policy - DeDupe2Activate</h1>
<p>This extension automatically closes duplicate tabs.</p>
<h2>What it needs access to</h2>
<p>Your tab URLs and tab activity - so it can tell which tabs are duplicates.</p>
<h2>What it does</h2>
<p>Finds tabs with the same URL, keeps the newer one, closes the old one. Everything happens in your browser.</p>
<h2>What it doesn't do</h2>
<p>Doesn't save anything. Doesn't send data anywhere. Just looks at your tabs temporarily to do the duplicate checking.</p>
